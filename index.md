## Scope
As the Internet of Things (IoT) is being massively deployed, and as agile software development and continuous deployment has become the norm, a challenging gap exists in terms of security and techniques for joint software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) on low-power IoT devices.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

The first IEEE LCN Special Track on DevSecOps in resource-constrained IoT networks (DRIN) is inviting  researchers to submit original and unpublished papers pertaining to DevOps and Security in resource-limited IoT environments.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Tailored as small workshop, DRIN aims to cover novel contributions regarding protocols, technologies, architectures, performance evaluation, optimization, modeling, implementation, simulation and experiments, as well as reports analyzing deployments and best practices for security, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and more generally for system software life-cycle management on resource-constrained, networked devices.

## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Tiny software containerization
- Software update security for post-issuance and CI/CD in low-power IoT devices
- Cloud continuum, edge & fog computing
- Reformable TinyML
- IoT DevSecOps use cases: Smart cities, e-health, Industry 4.0, home automation applications...
- Software Defined Internet of Things (IoT) & Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- Network Management for fleets of resource-constrained DevSecOps
- Embedded Software & platforms for low-power Internet of Things
- Secure wired & wireless communications for resource-constrained devices

## Important dates

- **Registration**: please register via [IEEE LCN](https://www.ieeelcn.org/)

## Author Information
Authors are invited to submit papers for presentation at the conference, describing original, previously unpublished work, not currently under review by another conference, workshop, or journal. 
Papers must be submitted electronically to EDAS in PDF format, US-Letter size (not A4), with all fonts embedded (the PDF-A standard meets this requirement). 
Please format your submission using the IEEE templates found [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Paper submissions may be up to six (6) camera-ready pages, 10 pt font in two-column IEEE format, excluding bibliography. 
Papers are expected to describe fully developed ideas with a thorough evaluation.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Note that DRIN follows a blind review policy (i.e. not double-blind). 
The names and affiliations of all the authors must be present in the submitted manuscript.
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Paper registration and submission will be through [EDAS](https://edas.info/N31739).
